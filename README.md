# Techdegree Project 2 -- Mobile-first Responsive Layout

This project's goal was to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout demonstrates responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

I wrote CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
